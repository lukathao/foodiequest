I am planning a trip to Hanoi, Vietnam from Thu Nov 21 2024 00:00:00 GMT-0600 (Central Standard Time) to Fri Nov 29 2024 00:00:00 GMT-0600 (Central Standard Time)
    Please generate a list called foods with url images of foods I should try without any consideration to my budget.
    The list should have the url image inside an img tag and the name of the food in a p tag.
    The list of food should be wrapped inside a div with the class of foods.

    Please generate a list called requirements of things I need to in order to get into the country.
    The list of requirements should be wrapped inside a div with the class requirements.
    
    Please generate a list called tour guides. Their contact information should be in a p tag with the class contact_info. 
    The website where you found their information should be in a separate p tag with the class site_info.
    The list of tour guides should be wrapped inside a div with the class tour_guides.
    
    The result should be HTML lists separated as requirements, activities, foods, and guides.
    Please format all the result as HTML.
